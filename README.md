# nwabap-ui5uploader
This module allows a developer to upload SAPUI5/OpenUI5 sources into a SAP NetWeaver ABAP system. The behavior is (or should be) the same than it is known from the SAP Web IDE app deployment option "Deploy to SAPUI5 ABAP Repository" or from the "SAPUI5 ABAP Repository Team Provider" available for Eclipse via the "UI Development Toolkit for HTML5".
The main reason for developing this module is to integrate the deployment process into a Continuous Integration environment, in which for instance a Jenkins server executes several build steps and finally deploys the sources to a SAP NetWeaver ABAP system if all previous build steps are ok.
The plugin also allows a developer to deploy the sources to a SAP NetWeaver ABAP system by a npm script using a different IDE than Eclipse or SAP Web IDE (for instance WebStorm).

### Based on grunt-nwabap-ui5uploader package
This module is based on the original grunt [plugin](https://github.com/pfefferf/grunt-nwabap-ui5uploader). Though I didn't like the need of gulp or grunt in my projects purely for CI/CD.

## Prerequisites
### ABAP Development Tool Services
The ABAP Development Tool Services have to be activated on the SAP NetWeaver ABAP System (transaction SICF, path /sap/bc/adt).
The user used for uploading the sources needs to have the authorization to use the ADT Services and to create/modify BSP applications.
The plugin is tested with NW 7.30, NW 7.40 and NW 7.50 systems.

## Install
Add it to your local project and use npx to run the binary using a `npx`-prefix (as of npm 5.2.0):

```npm install nwabap-ui5uploader --save-dev```

Or just install globally and skip the `npx`-prefix in the examples below:

```npm install -g nwabap-ui5uploader```

## Usage
This node module describes itself on the command line. Use your favorite CI/CD configuration to call this module.

```
npx nwabap --help
```
```
npx nwabap upload --help
```

### Configuration
| Option              | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| conn_server         |         | SAP host
| conn_user           |         | SAP user
| conn_client         |         | Optional parameter to specify the client (transferred as sap-client URL parameter). In case the option is not specified the default client is used if specified.
| conn_usestrictssl   | `true`  | SSL mode handling. In case of self signed certificates the useStrictSSL mode option can be set to false to allow an upload of files.
| base                |         | Base dir
| files               | **      | Files to upload (relative from basedir)
| ignore_files        |         | Array with file paths to be ignored
| abap_transport      |         | ABAP transport no.
| abap_package        |         | ABAP package name
| abap_bsp            |         | ABAP BSP container ID
| abap_bsp_text       |         | ABAP BSP container name
| abap_language       | EN      | ABAP language
| calcappindex        | `false` | Re-calculate application index
| git_diff_commit     |         | Optional git commit, branch or reference to compare current state with. Will only upload files that were somehow changed (added, modified or deleted) since specified state.
| git_diff_unstaged   | `false` | Include unstaged files in git diff.
| preserve_unselected | `false` | Don't delete files from BSP container, that were not selected to upload. Useful when using git_diff_commit option to keep unchanged files untouched.
| nwabaprc            |         | If set, specifies a different path for a ./.nwabaprc file

#### .nwabaprc
It is possible to use a configuration file. If this file exists in the project root, this tool will automatically discover it. Create a `.nwabaprc` file in your package root, i.e.:
```
{
    "base": "./dist",
    "conn_server": "http://myserver:8000",
    "conn_user": "upload",
    "conn_password": "upl04d",
    "abap_package": "$TMP",
    "abap_bsp": "ZZ_UI5_LOCAL",
    "abap_bsp_text": "UI5 upload local objects"
}
```
NOTE: command line arguments are ordered to be mapped after the configuration file. This means that the command line arguments override individual configuration file attributes.

### Examples
#### Upload to $TMP package
```
npx nwabap upload --base ./dist --conn_server http://myserver:8000 --conn_user upload --conn_password upl04d --abap_package $TMP --abap_bsp ZZ_UI5_LOCAL --abap_bsp_text "UI5 upload local objects"
```

#### Upload to a transport tracked package
```
npx nwabap upload --base ./dist --conn_server http://myserver:8000 --conn_user upload --conn_password upl04d --abap_package ZFRONTENDS_TEST --abap_bsp ZABSHR --abap_bsp_text "Absence HR" --abap_transport PRDNK1230120032
```

#### Use package.json script
```
"scripts": {
    "upload": "npx nwabap upload"
}
```

#### Different .nwabaprc location/file
```
npx nwabap upload ... --nwabaprc ./config/.nwabaprc2
```

## Contribute
My actual goal is to remove all unnecessary code and libs, except console coloring libs since I find these really helpful. I would also like to rewrite the libs used ([filestore](lib/filestore.js) and [filestoreutils](lib/filestoreutils.js)). Please, and feel free to help me anytime on the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/nrdev88/nwabap-ui5uploader).
